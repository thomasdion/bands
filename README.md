This project was made by Dionisis Thomas(2012 PHP 5.x.x).

It is a website(initialy made for music bands) which provides users register and login  and an administrator interface. 
Users can see most of website material, search for tour dates in a calendar and if they have an account even write comments and replies.  
It was based on The MVC (Model-View-Controler) architectural pattern.
Each page is a php file that loads the appropriate  Controler. 
Controllers are responsible for loading the templates, activating and checking sessions and the DBConnections.
Templates are under (templates) folder :-P. HTML5 semantics were used.
Controlers under (control) and libraries under (lib) folder.
Administrators interface is under folder molonlave.
config.php defines  url and absolute paths and also defines the mapping of templates and pages!

Front-end BOILERPLATE template was used.
Sliding Login Panel was provided by Jeremie Tisseau URI: http://web-kreation.com/
