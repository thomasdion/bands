    <header><h1>Matthew Dakoutros</h1></header>
<p>Matthew plays the violin since he was five. He has taken lessons with some of the best violin teachers in Greece, such as Nancy Bargerstock and Nina Patrikidou, and has finished his studies with George Despotidis. He has performed in many concerts as a solo artist, or part of a small group since he was a kid. He has also been a part of many juvenile orchestras, and some professional ones, to some of them as concertmaster, performing with them in almost every major concert hall in Greece (The Athens Concert Hall, Odeon of Herodes Atticus, etc). Since 2003 he works as a private violin tutor and in 2007 he started working in the National Conservatory, Greece.
He joined Wastefall in 2003 and together they recorded "Soulrain 21" (Album of the month in Metal Hammer and Rock Hard, GR), and had the opportunity to support groups like Pain of Salvation, Fates Warning and Black Sabbath. He has been also a member of other groups, and has recorded for artists like Empty Frame, Mike G and others. Since 2003, Matthew and one of his best friends and collaborators, Nikos Miras, created art of simplicity. </p>
