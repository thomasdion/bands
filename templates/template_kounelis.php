Since then, performed -and still performing- a large number of gigs with DISHARMONY. Also performed along with dearest friends on stage: DREAM DEVOID, ENTROPIA and more. In 1999-2000 recorded the "When Purity Withers" mini CD (DISHARMONY) which gained amazing reviews from Press and fans from all over the world. In 2009, he recorded also 2 new songs with the metal Greek legends SORROWFUL WINDS. In 2010, DISHARMONY completed their full-length "Shades Of Insanity" album. In the same year, Chris starting singing for the BIGUS DICKUS project (live-cover band).
